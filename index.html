</p> I'm way too ADHD to ever tolerate a job for very long if it's tedious or uninteresting and one such dreadful aspect of coding is setting up & configuring databases. But that's no longer a necessary evil with StackMob. They provide a cloud-based mobile backend in the form of a NoSQL data store (transition guide & cheat sheet on back) with an OAuth-secured REST API that they generate for your data models. That's cool and all, but StackMob's goal is to help mobile devs build, deploy & grow their mobile APPS, not just their databases...and they're killing it when it comes to meeting that goal. You can check out the details I've highlighted below.</p>

<p>StackMob will save you a ton of time, not just with prepping your backend, but also with coding your server & client. That means more time to focus on making your features shine. What's more, if your project continues beyond the trip, you won't have to worry about rewriting the entire codebase! Hooray for reusability!</p>

<p>So from StackMob & myself, congrats on getting chosen for the Louisiana StartupBus...now let's hack our asses off! If you need anything, you can ask me, tweet to @StackMob with #startupbus or open up a support ticket at http://support.stackmob.com. (StackMob is also AWESOME when it comes to service, btw!)</p>
